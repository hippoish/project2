####Description:
This app will provide a place for people to connect with coworkers or fellow students who live near them and are interested in carpooling! After creating an account, a user can access the ride board for their neighborhood/area and post messages detailing their commuting schedules, what they are looking for, and other details.  They can then start carpools or join existing groups.

The MVP will be for a single workplace/school with many employees commuting from different areas. It will allow users to create and view carpools and join one at a time. Stretch goals include integrating mapping functionality to locate and group users, and having a group administrator to make sure all users are actual members of the destination community.

####Other Stuff
I would like to ultimately make the app more restrictive and useful for actually planning: limit users in carpool based on seats, integrate maps for more precise matching of users, etc. I would like to have an administrator who has to confirm when a user signs up that they are a member of the GA community, for security reasons.
